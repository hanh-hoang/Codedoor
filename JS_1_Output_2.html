They should state their name and a number. 
If the number is above 5, they will our amazing cheese pretzels for life. 
Display a prompt box which asks the user for her/his name. 
Create a const variable called newUser and save what the user has entered to the variable. 
Create a function that checks if the user has entered her username and if so prints out: "Hello USERNAME"'. 
Learn how to use the switch statement. Learn how to generate a random number. Let the user enter a number via prompt. 
Save the random number to a variable. Use the number stored in the variable. If the number is below 5 print out: this is too low. 
If its above 5 print out: this is sufficiently high enough. Push your code to GitHub.
